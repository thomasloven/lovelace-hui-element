# hui-element

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

The Lovelace interface for Home Assistant has three types of objects, those are:

**Cards**
Examples include `entities`, `glance`, `vertical-stack`, `gauge`, `media-player`.

**Entity rows**
The individual rows in an entities card. Examples include `section`, `call-service`, `conditional`, `cast`, but also `sensor-entity`, `toggle-entity`, `climate-entity` and several more that a normal user never have to bother with.

**Elements**
The elements used in a picture-elements card. Examples include `state-badge`, `state-label`, `image`.

When you select a `type:` for something, what is loaded will depend on where.
E.g. specifying `type: conditional` in a lovelace view or a stack card will load a conditional card, but specifying `type: conditional` in an entities card will load a conditional entity row.

Sometimes you may want to use things in other places, though. That's where `hui-element` comes in.

## Usage

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=thomasloven&repository=lovelace-hui-element)

For installation, updating and debugging instructions [see this guide](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-config/wiki/Lovelace-Plugins).

Let's say you want to use the `section` entity row in place of a card.

Normally, a section row configuration may look like:

```yaml
type: section
label: Important things
```

To make it work as a card, change it to:

```yaml
type: custom:hui-element
row_type: section
label: Important things
```

I.e., change `type:` to `row_type:` and add `type: custom:hui-element`.

`hui-element` will then load the correct row and place it wherever you want it.

Similarly, to put a glance card inside an entities card:

```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - light.bed_light
  - type: custom:hui-element
    card_type: glance
    entities:
      - light.kitchen_lights
      - light.ceiling_lights
```

> Note: In some cases, the internal types may need to be used.
> I.e. to add a media player row as a card, you'd need to specify `row_type: media-player-entity`.

> Note2: It may also work to set `row_type: default` and hui-element will figure out the correct row type by itself.

The correct types to use can be found in the frontend source code for [cards](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/blob/dev/src/panels/lovelace/create-element/create-card-element.ts), [entity-rows](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/blob/dev/src/panels/lovelace/create-element/create-row-element.ts) and [elements](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/blob/dev/src/panels/lovelace/create-element/create-hui-element.ts).

### A note on card-mod

If you are using [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod), `hui-element` will be "transparent".

I.e. styling `hui-element` itself should be as if styling the element inside it.

Ex:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1299821/142607774-3676597d-ae67-4731-adac-0ea981683b5e.png)

```yaml
- type: entities
  entities:
    - type: section
      label: Default internal styling
      card_mod:
        style: |
          .divider {
            background-color: red;
          }
    - type: custom:hui-element
      row_type: section
      label: Hui-element internal styling
      card_mod:
        style: |
          .divider {
            background-color: green;
          }
- type: entities
  entities:
    - type: section
      label: Default styled from card
    - type: custom:hui-element
      row_type: section
      label: Hui-element styled from card
  card_mod:
    style:
      hui-section-row $: |
        .divider { background-color: blue; }
      hui-element $: |
        .divider { background-color: orange;}
```

## FAQ

**Does this replace the `custom:hui-` trick?**
Yes. That's where the name is from.
The `custom:hui-` trick was always a dirty hack that worked by accident rather than design, and since 0.107 it works intermittently at best.
